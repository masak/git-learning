## The initial Git

This directory chronicles the initial version of Git, as remembered by the
`git` repository on Github.

The initial Git contained only seven commands.

    update-cache    add and remove things from the staging area
    show-diff       shell out to the diff command
    init-db         initialize the .dircache/ directory
    write-tree      create a tree object from the staging area
    read-tree       list the contents of a given tree object
    commit-tree     package a tree object into a commit
    cat-file        list contents of object

At this time, the `.git/` directory was called `.dircache/`.

A copy of the contents of the `e83c51` commit can be found in the `contents/`
directory.
