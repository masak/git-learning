This is my private note-taking scratchpad while I'm doing a deep dive into Git.
It's mostly for me, but maybe you'll find it useful too. Who knows.

I find it useful to write down questions explicitly, and then find the answers
and write them down too. So this is what I will be doing with Git. The goal: to 
learn Git in depth. What is are *really* the dreams that stuff is made of? How
do things work and why? Inner secrets, mysteries, source code, etc.

A quick map:

    terms/                  Like "commit", "index", etc.
    questions/              Divided into topics, subcommands, etc.

    porcelain/              High-level commands
    plumbing/               Low-level commands

    first/                  A study of e83c51, the first Git commit
    releases/               When, what, and why
