## shallow cloning

**Q: What, precisely, does a shallow clone do? I know it clones fewer objects,
but what happens under the hood?**

**Hint:**

    <ixon> If I have cloned a repository with --depth=1, how can I grab more past commits?
    <_ikke_> ixon: git fetch --depth=x, or if you want all, git fetch --unshallow
