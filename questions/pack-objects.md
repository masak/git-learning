## lookup

**Q: Once an object has been packed, how can it be found, quickly and
efficiently? Do we need to iterate through all the existing packfiles?**

## format

**Q: What's the format of the packfiles?**

A: See [pack-format.txt](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/pack-format.txt).

**Q: Anything else you can tell me?**

Yes.
[This](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.6.2.3/technical/pack-heuristics.txt)
is an *awesome* reasource. If only all documentation were written like that!
