## what

**Q: What does `git cherry` do?**

    <soren> I have these two branches, and I'd like to learn how they differ. The diff is huge and not a very good narrative. 
            I'd like to see what stuff has been applied on one, but isn't on the other, and the other way around so that I can 
            understand how they differ by simply looking at the commit messages.
    <cmn> that's git-cherry
