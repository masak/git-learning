## grafts

**Q: What the heck are grafts?**

From [glossary-content](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/glossary-content.txt):

    Grafts enables two otherwise different lines of development to be joined
    together by recording fake ancestry information for commits. This way
    you can make Git pretend the set of <<def_parent,parents>> a <<def_commit,commit>> has
    is different from what was recorded when the commit was
    created. Configured via the `.git/info/grafts` file.
